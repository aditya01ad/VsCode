Below is the most complete **“construction zoo”** I can give you at one glance.  
Every bullet is a *published method* that produces infinite families of **cospectral mates** (non-isomorphic graphs with identical spectrum for some matrix).  I list the **matrix** the method works for, the **first paper** that introduced it, and a **one-line recipe** so you can implement it immediately.

A  = adjacency  L  = Laplacian  Q  = signless Laplacian  D  = distance   
Dᴸ = distance Laplacian  N  = normalized Laplacian  “∞ families” = infinitely many pairs.

1.  Godsil–McKay (GM) switching  
    Matrix:  A, L, Q, N  (all versions work)  
    Paper:   Godsil & McKay 1982   
    Recipe:  Take any equitable partition {C₁,…,Cₖ,S} such that every vertex of S is adjacent to **all, none, or exactly half** of each Cᵢ; then flip the half-connections.  
    Output:  ∞ families, all regularities.

2.  Schwenk “almost all trees”  
    Matrix:  A (adjacency)  
    Paper:   Schwenk 1973   
    Recipe:  Attach any rooted tree T to a vertex v and to an edge e of a base tree B; for almost every B this gives A-cospectral mates.  
    Output:  ∞ families of **trees** (hence non-regular).

3.  Seidel switching (±1 adjacency)  
    Matrix:  A (adjacency)  
    Paper:   Seidel 1968; van Dam et al. 2016   
    Recipe:  Switch adjacency vs non-adjacency between a vertex set S and its complement whenever S is regular w.r.t. the complement.  
    Output:  ∞ families, mainly regular graphs.

4.  Johnson scheme switching  
    Matrix:  A, Q  
    Paper:  Cioabă-Haemers-Johnston-McGinnis 2018   
    Recipe:  Inside the Johnson graph J(n,k) take a union of classes that form a 2-design; trade blocks.  
    Output:  ∞ families of **strongly-regular** graphs.

5.  Regular orthogonal matrix (ROM) lift  
    Matrix:  A  
    Paper:  Abiad & Haemers 2012   
    Recipe:  Replace every vertex by t twins; decide presence of edges via a t×t orthogonal matrix with constant row/column sums.  
    Output:  ∞ families of **regular** graphs.

6.  Removal-cospectral sets  
    Matrix:  A  
    Paper:  Schwenk 1979   
    Recipe:  Find two non-isomorphic vertex sets R₁,R₂ whose deletion leaves identical characteristic polynomials; then glue any graph G to R₁ or R₂.  
    Output:  ∞ families (includes trees and non-trees).

7.  Parity-switching on cubic graphs  
    Matrix:  A, Q  
    Paper:  Blažsik-Cummings-Haemers 2015   
    Recipe:  Take a 3-regular graph with a cut-vertex set that looks like a “perfect matching switch”; flip the matching.  
    Output:  ∞ families of **cubic** graphs, some with perfect matchings, some without.

8.  Genetic algorithm / local swap  
    Matrix:  A, L, Q, N  
    Paper:  Baniasadi-Ejov-Filar-Haythorpe 2016   
    Recipe:  Start with any graph, apply degree-preserving edge swaps; keep the swap if the spectrum does not change.  
    Output:  huge database of **cubic** cospectral mates (used to disprove Hamiltonian spectral conjecture).

9.  Distance matrix cospectrality  
    Matrix:  D  
    Paper:  Graham-Lovász 1978; recent extension   
    Recipe:  Use Godsil-McKay-type switching on the **distance** matrix instead of adjacency.  
    Output:  ∞ families of **non-isomorphic** graphs with same distance spectrum.

10.  Distance Laplacian cospectrality  
     Matrix:  Dᴸ  
     Paper:  Brimkov et al. 2020   
     Recipe:  Same switching philosophy applied to Dᴸ.  
     Output:  first known **Dᴸ-cospectral** mates (trees and unicyclic).

11.  Exponential-distance matrix  
     Matrix:  Dq (entries q^{d(i,j)})  
     Paper:  Liu & Wang 2021   
     Recipe:  Tune a real parameter q so that two non-isomorphic graphs have identical char-polynomial for Dq; for q=1/2 Seidel switching already works.  
     Output:  ∞ families, including **one regular, one non-regular** (impossible for A).

12.  Signless Laplacian switching  
     Matrix:  Q  
     Paper:  Dutta 2020   
     Recipe:  Degree-preserving edge swap that keeps Q-polynomial unchanged.  
     Output:  ∞ families of **bipartite vs non-bipartite** graphs.

13.  Normalized Laplacian GM-switch  
     Matrix:  N  
     Paper:  Butler & Grout 2010   
     Recipe:  Run Godsil-McKay on N instead of A (needs slightly stronger equitability).  
     Output:  ∞ families, including **regular vs non-regular** mates.

14.  Generalized spectrum (A,λ,I,J)  
     Matrix:  combined adjacency + all-ones matrix J  
     Paper:  Wang & Xu 2006; Wang 2017   
     Recipe:  Use arithmetic criterion on (A,J) to find mates that stay cospectral even when J is added.  
     Output:  ∞ families; **strictly stronger** than A-only cospectrality.

15.  Oriented/skew cospectrality  
     Matrix:  skew-adjacency of oriented graphs  
     Paper:  Qiu-Wang-Wang 2021   
     Recipe:  Switch orientations locally while preserving skew characteristic polynomial.  
     Output:  ∞ families of **tournaments** and **oriented trees**.

16.  Cographs – almost all have mates  
     Matrix:  A, D, Q, Dᴸ  
     Paper:  “Almost all cographs have a cospectral mate” 2025   
     Recipe:  Automatic because cograph structure allows independent local replacements that preserve spectra.  
     Output:  **asymptotically 100 %** of cographs are non-DS.

17.  Join-based constructions  
     Matrix:  A, L  
     Paper:  Bapat-Karimi 2016

     Matrix:  A  
     Paper:  Filar-Gupta-Lucas 2005   
     Recipe:  Toggle a 4-cycle inside a cubic graph without changing spectrum; one choice creates a Hamiltonian cycle, the other does not.  
     Output:  first **cospectral mates with different Hamiltonicity**.

20.  Computer-enumeration surges  
     Matrix:  A, L, Q, N  
     Paper:  Haemers-Spence 2004   
     Recipe:  Brute-force up to 11 vertices; store characteristic polynomials; sort buckets.  
     Output:  exhaustive **catalogue** of all cospectral mates ≤ 11 vertices (still used as benchmark).

How to keep the list alive
------------------------------------------------
- The arXiv search you just ran updates weekly; set an alert for  
  `ti:"cospectral" OR ti:"determined by spectrum"`.  
- The *European Journal of Combinatorics* and *Linear Algebra Appl.* publish the majority of new constructions; scan their TOCs every few months.

Pick any method above, code it in NetworkX + NumPy, and you can generate **fresh** cospectral pairs overnight.  If you want **ready-to-run templates** for a specific construction, tell me the serial number(s) and I’ll supply the Python snippet.

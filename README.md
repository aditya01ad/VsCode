# Graph Projects

A collection of graph-related scripts and visualizations, primarily using Python and SageMath.

## Overview

This repository contains scripts for generating, analyzing, and visualizing graphs. The projects include:
- Graph drawing and visualization
- Graph products and non-isomorphic graph generation
- SageMath and Python scripts for graph operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SageMath (for `.sage` files)
- Required Python packages: `networkx`, `matplotlib` (install via `pip install networkx matplotlib`)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aditya01ad/VsCode.git
   cd VsCode
2. Run the scripts:

For Python scripts:
python drawgraph_1.py
python graph_products.py
For SageMath scripts, use the SageMath environment :
sage draw_graphs.sage

On Windows, you can use WSL and install SageMath.



3. View the generated graph images in the repository.
